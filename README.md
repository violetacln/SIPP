# SIPP
Statistics Iceland's Population Projections, _work in progress_.

Here we share our models/R-scripts for building population projections. 

The slides of a presentation at the [NDS-2022](https://nds2021.demografi.no/) in Oslo  are included ([SIPP_june2022.pdf](https://github.com/violetacln/SIPP/blob/main/SIPP_june2022.pdf)). The slides of a presentation at [uRos-2022](https://r-project.ro/conference2022.html) are uploaded as ([SIPP_uRos2022.pdf](https://github.com/violetacln/SIPP/blob/main/SIPP_uRos2022.pdf)). A contribution focused on local projections was presented at [NTTS-2023]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/NTTS2023_en) and a more complete presentation is given at [ISI-WSC-2023](https://www.isi2023.org/).
