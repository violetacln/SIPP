# SIPP
Statistics Iceland's Population Projections, _work in progress_.

Here we share our models/R-scripts for building population projections. 

The [slides](https://github.com/violetacln/SIPP/blob/main/SIPP_june2022.pdf) of a presentation at the [NDS-2022](https://nds2021.demografi.no/) in Oslo  are included as well as the [slides](https://github.com/violetacln/SIPP/blob/main/SIPP_uRos2022.pdf) of a presentation at [uRos-2022](https://r-project.ro/conference2022.html). A contribution focused on local projections was presented at [NTTS-2023]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/NTTS2023_en) and a more complete presentation is given at [ISI-WSC-2023](https://www.isi2023.org/).
A Working Paper, entitled "Methodology of population projections based on hierarchical Bayesian models" has been published in the Statistical Series of Statistics Iceland can be found [here](http://hagstofan.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/2023/79a217c5-f567-4ddb-bed7-45329a32d531.pdf).
